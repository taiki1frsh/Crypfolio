# Crypfolio

The portfolio for Cryptocurrencies which is able to show 
the proportional circle fig and the trasition of total amount
of money from the flexible start time to now.

But, since my ablity of python programming is highly low, you have to 
write some stuffs.

I write how to use this.
First of all, you have to define your portfolio with the type of dictionary
(examples are in file).

And you set some arguments to each functions by the comment.
