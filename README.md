# Crypfolio

The portfolio for Cryptocurrencies which is able to show the proportional circle figure by using coingecho api.

But, since my ablity of python programming is highly low, you have to 
write some stuffs.

I write down how to use.
First of all, you have to define your portfolio with the type of dictionary(examples are in file).

And you set some arguments to each functions by the comment.    

In the end, you can get some infomation in ternimal and a circle image like below.

For the record, this is the first python app and futhermore first program that I wrote as an app.
